This is a small set of tools to demonstrate the difference between
JSON and YAML syntax, using a set of Kubernetes configurations from 
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/guestbook.

To generate the YAML files:

    make

To generate "examples.md":

    sh gen-examples.sh
